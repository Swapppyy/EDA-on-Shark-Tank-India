## Data Analysis on my favorite TV show Shark Tank India

### Introduction:

I did a deep dive into the data from Shark Tank India, my favorite TV show. Basically, I used SQL to sift through the data and find interesting stuff about the number of pitches, which ones got funding, where the brands were located, and details about the average equity and investments made by different sharks. The goal was to uncover patterns and connections in the data

I web scraped wikipedia data of Shark tank season 1 and transformed it using Excel. I have uploaded the ready file in the github repo for this project.
  
### Aim of this project:

•	Total Number of Episodes<br>

•	Total number of pitches<br>

•	Pitches that received Funding<br>

•	Total amount invested by Sharks<br>

•	Distribution of genders on the teams<br>

•	Highest investement and equity taken by any of the shark<br>

•	Partner deals of sharks<br>

•	Table of my 4 favorite sharks and their investments information<br>

•	Startup in which the highest amount has been invested in each domain/sector<br>
